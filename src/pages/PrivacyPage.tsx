        <p className="text-black">
          OutrankPilot (“OutrankPilot,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) values your
          privacy and is committed to protecting the personal information you
          share with us. This Privacy Policy explains how information is
          collected, used, stored, and protected when you access or use the
          OutrankPilot website, platform, and related services (collectively,
          the “Service”).
        </p>

        <p className="text-black">
          By using OutrankPilot, you acknowledge that you have read, understood,
          and agreed to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

          1. Information We Collect
        </h2>
        <p className="text-black">
          When you use OutrankPilot, we collect certain information to enable
          the Service to function properly and to improve its performance. This
          includes information you voluntarily provide, such as your name, email
          address, billing details, and account preferences when you create an
          account, subscribe to a plan, or contact support. Payment information
          is handled securely by third-party payment processors, and
          OutrankPilot does not store full payment card details.
        </p>
        <p className="text-black">
          We also collect limited information automatically when you interact
          with the Service. This may include your IP address, browser type,
          device information, operating system, referral URLs, and general usage
          data such as pages visited and features accessed.
        </p>
        <p className="text-black">
          OutrankPilot does not intentionally collect sensitive personal data
          such as government-issued identification numbers or financial account
          credentials.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black">
          2. Content Processing and Publishing Data
        </h2>
        <p className="text-black">
          OutrankPilot is intentionally designed to minimize the storage of user
          content and sensitive operational data. While content is processed
          temporarily in order to generate or publish articles as requested by
          users, we do not retain WordPress login credentials, API keys,
          long-term content drafts, or historical publishing records beyond what
          is technically necessary to deliver the Service.
        </p>
        <p className="text-black">
          Generated content belongs entirely to the user and is processed solely
          for the purpose of fulfilling user requests. OutrankPilot does not use
          customer content for advertising, resale, or public marketing, and
          content is not stored longer than required for operational delivery.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black">
          3. How We Use Your Information
        </h2>
        <p className="text-black">
          The information we collect is used strictly to operate, maintain, and
          improve the OutrankPilot platform. This includes managing user
          accounts, processing subscriptions and payments, providing customer
          support, communicating service-related updates, preventing fraud or
          abuse, and ensuring compliance with legal obligations. We may also use
          aggregated and anonymized data to analyze usage trends and improve
          platform performance. Such data does not identify individual users.
          OutrankPilot does not sell, rent, or trade personal information to
          third parties for marketing purposes.

          4. Artificial Intelligence and Automated Processing
        </h2>
        <p className="text-black">
          OutrankPilot uses artificial intelligence technologies to generate
          written content based on user input and configuration. This processing
          is automated and occurs in real time to deliver the Service. Users
          acknowledge that AI-generated content may contain inaccuracies,
          omissions, or outdated information and that all content should be
          reviewed before publication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Responsibility for the use, publication, and distribution of generated
          content remains with the user at all times.

          5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies
        </h2>
        <p className="text-black">
          OutrankPilot uses cookies and similar technologies to maintain
          essential functionality, manage user sessions, and analyze platform
          usage. These technologies allow us to provide a consistent and secure
          experience. You may choose to disable cookies through your browser
          settings; however, doing so may limit certain features or
          functionality of the Service.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black">
          6. Third-Party Services
        </h2>
        <p className="text-black">
          We rely on trusted third-party service providers to support core
          business operations, including payment processing, hosting
          infrastructure, analytics, and system monitoring. These providers are
          granted access only to the information necessary to perform their
          services and are contractually obligated to protect user data. When
          you connect OutrankPilot to third-party platforms such as WordPress,
          Ghost, Webflow, Shopify, or similar services, your interactions with
          those platforms are governed by their respective privacy policies.
          OutrankPilot is not responsible for the data practices or security
          policies of third-party services.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black">7. Data Security</h2>
        <p className="text-black">
          We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational
          safeguards designed to protect personal information against
          unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. While we
          take security seriously, no method of transmission over the internet
          or electronic storage is completely secure. As such, we cannot
          guarantee absolute data security, and users acknowledge and accept
          this inherent risk.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black">8. Data Retention</h2>
        <p className="text-black">
          OutrankPilot retains personal information only for as long as
          necessary to provide the Service, comply with legal obligations,
          resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. When information is no
          longer required, it is securely deleted or anonymized in accordance
          with industry standards.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black">
          9. Your Privacy Rights
        </h2>
        <p className="text-black">
          Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights related to your
          personal data, including the right to access, correct, delete, or
          restrict certain processing activities. You may also withdraw consent
          where consent is the lawful basis for processing. Requests related to
          data rights can be submitted to support@outrankpilot.com, and we will
          respond within a reasonable timeframe in accordance with applicable
          laws.

          10. International Data Transfers
        </h2>
        <p className="text-black">
          OutrankPilot may process and store information in countries other than
          your country of residence. By using the Service, you consent to the
          transfer and processing of your information in accordance with this
          Privacy Policy and applicable data protection laws.

          in legal requirements, technology, or business practices. Updates will
          be posted on this page with a revised “Last Updated” date. Continued
          use of the Service after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of
